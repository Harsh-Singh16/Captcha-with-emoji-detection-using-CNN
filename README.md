# Captcha-with-emoji-detection-using-CNN
In this project we are given a handwritten captcha which contains either english alphabets(capital) or emoji or both and we have to read it using CNN.
In this project I have created one notebook for data loading, preprocessing, segmentation and everything.
The used datasets are emoji.csv and A_Z Handwritten Data.csv
For running this project, we should run main.py file.
